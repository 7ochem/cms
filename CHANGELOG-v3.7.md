# Release Notes for Craft CMS 3.7

### Added
- Added the “Reduce focus visibility” user preference. ([#7790](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7790))

- Edit Entry pages no longer appear to create a draft when the Current revision is edited within Live Preview. Unsaved changes are now stored within a “provisional draft”, which is mostly hidden from the author. ([#7899](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/7899))

- It’s now possible to reorder global sets. ([#8052](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/8052))
