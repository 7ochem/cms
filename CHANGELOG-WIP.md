# Release Notes for Craft CMS 5.0 (WIP)

### Changed
- Craft now requires PHP 8.1 or later.
- The `defaultTemplateExtensions` config setting now lists `twig` before `html` by default. ([#11809](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11809))
- Control panel templates referenced without a file extension now resolve `.twig` over `.html`. ([#11809](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11809))
